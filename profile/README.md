## Welcome to the demo org for GitHub Actions Fundamentals üëã

In this organization you will find multiple repositories used to demo the functionalities in scope for the training.

Each demo repo is prefixed with `demo-`, and will contain a `README.md` describing how to walk through it. üçø

:bulb: Some of the demo repositories are configured as templates, so that you can use them in a different organization or in your user account. Some demos contain features that are not available outside of GHEC/GHES, in these cases you will find info in each repo describing how to perform the demo.

:bow: Thank you for following the **Cleanup** steps described in the `README`'s!
